# Stuff Lending System OO-Design
This document describes the design according to the requirements presented in assignment 2.

I am seeing stuffLendingSystem as the actor organizing/processing all of the wishes a user might have. Therefor, this class WAS originally in the controller, however I realized it also held data that the view needs to read (the list of members). I then moved it to the model, perhaps this class could really be split into two classes, with one part being an "actor" in the controller (since it does feel kind of empty now..) and one part being the member list in the model... (I am running out of time to test out a refactoring of this)

I am assuming that when a certain item is wanted to be borrowed, the member trying to borrow it has "kind of been on the owning members profile page/seen member and its items in the list members option" and therefore is aware of its memberId and the name of the item it wants to borrow.

## Architectural Overview
The application uses the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The view is passive and gets called from the controller. The view may only read information from the model, not directly change it.
